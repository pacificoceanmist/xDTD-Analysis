# xDTD Analysis

## Overview

The xDTD Analysis repository is dedicated to the investigation and analysis of variances in xDTD models, with a focus on predicting diseases. This project is a part of the rotation project at David Koslicki Lab.

## Rotation Project Objectives

1. **Investigate Variances Between the Models:**
   - Explore and analyze differences between xDTD models.
   
2. **Select Diseases and Identify Changes in Prediction Probabilities:**
   - Choose the top 10 diseases and examine any alterations in prediction probabilities.

3. **Stability of Prediction Probabilities:**
   - Assess whether the prediction probabilities remain stable between different model version.

## Repository Contents

### Jupyter Notebook Script

The core of the analysis is encapsulated in the Jupyter notebook script. This script contains the necessary code to perform the xDTD analysis, addressing the rotation project objectives.

### Figures

The folder holds the visual output results of the analysis. These results are presented in both PDF and JPEG formats, providing a comprehensive view of the analysis outcomes.

### Data

The folder contains compressed CSV files utilized for the analysis. These resources are essential for reproducing the analysis and verifying the results.

## Getting Started

To begin your analysis or reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/xDTD-Analysis.git

2. Navigate the project directory:
   ```bash 
   cd xDTD-Analysis
   ```
3. Import, or download, and decompress the data files.

4. Open and run the Jupyter notebook scripts:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook <name of script>.ipynb
   ```
This will initiate the analysis and generate the results.
